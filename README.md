Personal projects in quantum computing code. Trying to learn both Qiskit and PennyLane and as I learn storing notebooks/code here. QiskitSchool folder contains all the labs that I've completed up until this point in the Qiskit online classes/course they offered in September of 2020 (all of which can be found here: https://qiskit.org/learn/intro-qc-qh/). All of the PennyLane tutorials I've been completing can be found on the PennyLane website here: https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos_basics.html/.

Another super great resource for learning the basics of quantum computing can be found here: https://cnot.io/background/maths/dirac_and_matrix.html offered by CNot.

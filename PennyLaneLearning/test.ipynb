    "Below we implement our basic quantum circuit. We begin by creating our simularion quantum computer. It is a pure state qubit simulator. A pure state qubit simulator means (thinking in terms of the Bloch Sphere), that we are able to generate points along the surface of this sphere, in contrast to a mixed state, where we are capable of generating points in the interior of the bloch sphere. Consider this as the type of data we want our quantum computer simulator to be able to generate.\n",
